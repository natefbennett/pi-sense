# PiSense

The server code will run on any system with Python and a webserver installed. That said the recomended hardware for the server is a Raspberry Pi. The client code was writen for and tested on an ESP32 Dev board. Currently the only suppored client sensor is the DHT22 temperature and humidity sensor. The front end interface is handled through one HTML file that can be dropped into any webserver such as Apache.
